# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This workspace is currently empty and ready for initialization.

## Common Development Commands

Once the project is initialized, add the following sections with actual commands:

### Build
```bash
# Add build command here (e.g., npm run build, pnpm build)
```

### Development
```bash
# Add dev/start command here (e.g., npm run dev, pnpm dev)
```

### Testing
```bash
# Add test command here (e.g., npm test, pnpm test)

# Add single test command here (if applicable)
```

### Linting
```bash
# Add lint command here (e.g., npm run lint, pnpm lint)
```

### Type Checking (if using TypeScript)
```bash
# Add type check command here (e.g., npm run type-check)
```

## High-Level Architecture

Add architecture documentation here once the project structure is established. Include:
- Core application structure and patterns
- Key libraries and frameworks being used
- Data flow and state management approach
- API structure (if applicable)
- Component organization (for UI projects)

## Development Workflow

1. Initialize the project structure based on the chosen tech stack
2. Set up core development tools (testing, linting, building)
3. Establish code organization patterns
4. Document any specific project conventions

## Tech Stack (To Be Determined)

- **Runtime**: Node.js/Other
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript/Other
- **Framework**: React/Vue/Angular/Next.js/Express/Other
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest/Playwright/Other
- **Styling**: CSS Modules/Tailwind/Styled Components/Other
